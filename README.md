## Motivation

The traditional way of working and searching for jobs can be a real grind. Endless hours of commuting, rigid schedules, and the pressure to be available 24/7 can quickly wear you out. 
As someone who has experienced this firsthand, I know how frustrating it can be to waste so much time looking for the right opportunity.
That's why I was inspired to create a solution that would make the process of finding a job and managing a career easier and more efficient.

Jobeng was born out of a desire to make a change. I wanted to create a platform that would help people find the best jobs and recruiters without sacrificing their time and energy. 

I am confident that this project will make a real difference in the lives of many people, and I encourage others to contribute and help make this vision a reality. 
Whether you are a developer, designer, or simply passionate about remote work, I invite you to join us in making the future of work a better place. 
Together, we can create a platform that will revolutionize the way we work and live.
